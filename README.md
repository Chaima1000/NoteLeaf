# 📒 Notebook Web App

## 💡 Description
Welcome to my **Notebook Web App**, a personal project where I combined backend development and frontend design. This web app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. It features user authentication (register/login) and a simple, cute design inspired by a girlish logo I created. 🌸
